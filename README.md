### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postdoc chemist on a constant adventure to embrace the wonders of data science, machine learning, and the ever-evolving world of technology. 
My expertise lies in analytical chemistry, spectroscopies, and univariate and multivariate statistical data analysis. ðŸ’«ðŸ§ªðŸ’»
My recent research concentrated on implementing process monitoring strategies through multivariate analysis.
Actually, studying possible approaches to address application issues spanning from sampling issues to data analysis is my cup of tea (or coffee, to be honest â˜•)
I'm fascinated by marketing, organization, Six Sigma, and the art of effective communication. I'm like a sponge, always eager to soak up new insights. ðŸ§½ðŸ§  

I'm here to learn, contribute, collaborate, and catch up with amazing people and programming communities. 
Don't hesitate to get in touch!
